        <p>
          It all started with an idea. What if we combined our love of salmon with our love of cookies? Thus the salmon cookie was born as seen here:

          Pat and the family have been making and enjoying salmon cookies ever since. They currently are operating 5 locations with more to come!

        <h3> Issaquah Salmon Days!</h3>
          <p>
            The <a href="https://www.salmondays.org/">Issaquah Salmon Days</a> is a two-day award-winning free festival held in Issaquah, Washington, United States, held from 10am to 6pm on the Saturday and Sunday of the first full weekend of October. It is initiated by a parade, celebrating the return of the salmon to their birth-waters, that embraces Issaquah's history, culture, and ethnic diversity. The festival showcases over 270 arts and crafts artisans, attracting many Northwest artists. The art sold includes wood, glass, jewelry, paintings, pottery, and metal. There are five stages for live entertainment, including cover bands, a kids' stage, and a Bluegrass stage. Sporting events include 5K/10K runs (and a 1K run for kids), a Sporting Weekend which is held the weekend prior to the festival and includes geoteaming, a treasure hunt around Issaquah using GPS. Veterans' Memorial Park is used as the "Field of Fun" offering entertainment for children.
